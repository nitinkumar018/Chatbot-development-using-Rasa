# Project: Chatbot development using Rasa
## Rasa provides a framework for developing AI chatbot (chatgpt) that uses natural language understanding (NLU). ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) created by OpenAI
## chatbot is created on anaconda prompt using rasa framework
## first we created a new environment and then installed all the dependencies required in this project
## nlu file is a file in which we write all the questions which a user can ask to a chatbot. It includes intent and examples
## domain file is a file in which we write answer for each intent
## mapping is done either in rules.yml or stories.yml but we usually prefer stories over rules
## rasa has config.yml file which has pipeline of rasa

# intent_confusion_matrix.png shows each & every intent is correctly classified
# test_chatbot_rasa.jpg shows how our chatbot works once we train & test the model
